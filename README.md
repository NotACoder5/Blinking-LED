# Blinking LED

## Description 
As seen in the attached pictures, I have created code in C for an Arduino with a smiley face on it. 
This code slowly lights up each LED in the smile one by one. 
Then, when the button is held and the current cycle is finished, the eyes will glow up brightly and the smile with flash quickly. 

## Real Life Demonstration
I created the Arduino with the correct wiring and LEDS in real life. See the animation in real life in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6vLUUB7FkJrXhP2fqF6Jq6z42d0dJv-/view?usp=sharing).
